# These are aliases for tools managed with Docker.
# I started using docker recently for certain apps for a few reasons:
#   1. Reduce attack surface.
#   2. Debian runs behind on some security tooling, this helps stay up to date.
#   3. Reduce dependency hell
#
# Unfortunately this means: Docker images will eat a lot of space, they start slower, and if a maintainer removes a container I'm SOL. 
# As such I'm keeping a fairly high bar here. Only docker images updated by the maintainer are allowed.

# Amass, recon framework.
alias amass="docker run -it --rm -v '$HOME/.config/amass:/.config/amass caffix/amass'"


# This will update *all* the images. Maybe be careful about this. :)
alias qr_docker_update="docker images | grep -v REPOSITORY | cut -d \" \" -f 1 | xargs -L1 docker pull"
